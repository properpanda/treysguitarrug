## What is this site?

Trey's Guitar Rug is a dedicated chronicle of the rugs that Trey Anastasio — lead guitarist and frontman of Phish — stands on while performing live. If you've ever watched a Phish show and noticed the rug beneath Trey's feet, you're in the right place.

## Why rugs?

The guitar rug is a small but iconic part of Phish's stage setup. Over the years, the rugs have changed in style, color, and pattern, often reflecting different eras of the band's touring history. This site aims to document those changes, catalog the rugs by tour and year, and explore what makes each one unique.

## Who runs this?

Just a Phish fan who pays too much attention to stage details. If you have photos, tips, or rug sightings to share, feel free to reach out.
