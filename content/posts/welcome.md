Welcome to Trey's Guitar Rug — a site dedicated to one of the most overlooked details of the Phish live experience: the rug beneath Trey Anastasio's feet.

## The Mission

Every Phish tour brings new jams, new setlists, and sometimes — new rugs. This site will track and catalog the rugs that have appeared on stage across different tours and eras, from the early days to the latest run.

## What to Expect

We'll be posting articles covering:

- **Rug profiles** — detailed looks at specific rugs, including photos and the tours they appeared on
- **Tour coverage** — tracking which rug shows up at each stop
- **Historical deep dives** — looking back at classic rugs from Phish history

Stay tuned for more posts as we build out the archive. If you have rug photos or sightings to contribute, we'd love to hear from you.
